## Getting Started

This project is created with NextJS, TailwindCSS, react-query and redux-toolkit

Firstly, make sure that node is present in your system, then install the node modules in the project directory:

```bash
npm install
```
Secondly, replace the MONGODB_URI in next.config.js file with your MONGODB_URI. Here is an example of dummy URI from Mongo Atlas for understanding purposes:
```bash
mongodb+srv://urehman:<password>@myprojectcluster.jdcpbjy.mongodb.net/users
```

Thirdly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
